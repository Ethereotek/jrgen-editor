# jrgen-editor

jrgen-editor is a fork of jrgen that abandons the command-line and hosts your json-rpc spec on a node-red server with an embedded text editor for live-editing of the spec in either JSON or YAML. The schema can be saved to the server, so you don't have to worry about losing your work. The spec also allows you to send the example requests over UDP or TCP to an RPC server of your chosing, as defined in the schema. 

For more information on the schema format, check out the repo for the original jrgen doc generator: https://github.com/mzernetsch/jrgen.git
